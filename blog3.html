              <p>
                As organizations focus on growth, competition, and performance, both internally and externally, the need to properly share and use knowledge becomes even more important. Knowledge is one of the most valuable assets a company has because itâ€™s hard for competitors to copy, making knowledge sharing crucial for building a competitive edge and helping organizations adapt to changing environments. 

                Data science is a powerful tool that changes how we manage and share knowledge in ways we never thought possible earlier. From analyzing huge amounts of data to making it easier to share information without strict rules, data science is transforming how knowledge management is done, particularly in organisations. This Think Piece explores the importance of data science in capturing, understanding, and sharing knowledge. It also looks at the current problems with traditional knowledge management systems and how new technologies can improve them.

                                        Knowledge management (KM) can be a problematic area as it can mean different things to different people. But it is largely understood and accepted as the collection of methods relating to creating, sharing, using and managing the knowledge and information of an organization. It refers to a multidisciplinary approach to achieve organizational objectives by making the best use of knowledge.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        An established discipline since 1991, KM includes courses taught in the fields of business administration, information systems, management, library, and information science. Other fields may contribute to KM research, including information and media, computer science, public health and public policy. Several universities offer dedicated master's degrees in knowledge management.

                    <p>
                        By reflecting on and analysing our experiences, we can capture valuable insights to help improve our own performance. 
                        Sharing those distilled experiences means that collectively we can:

            <p> <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/natural-language-processing">Natural Language Processing (NLP)</a>  is one such technology. NLP allows computers to understand, interpret, and respond to human language, making it possible to analyze large volumes of text data quickly and accurately. By leveraging NLP, organizations can extract valuable insights from documents, emails, and other text-based content, facilitating more effective knowledge sharing across the organization. NLP's ability to automate the processing of unstructured data means that vast amounts of information can be made accessible and understandable to employees, regardless of their technical expertise.</p>
            <p>The last piece is important as it describes the whole KM approach.</p>
            <p><strong>Another key technology </strong> is <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/chatbots#:~:text=A%20chatbot%20is%20a%20computer,and%20automate%20responses%20to%20them.">Chatbots</a> which is a strong application under NLP and increasingly being used to streamline knowledge sharing within organizations. Chatbots, powered by data science and machine learning algorithms, can interact with employees, answer questions (QA Bots), and provide information on demand. This not only reduces the time employees spend searching for information but also ensures that knowledge is consistently available, even in large organizations with complex information systems.

For organizations, this means that knowledge can be more intuitively visualized and explored, enabling employees to uncover connections and insights that might otherwise go unnoticed. Knowledge graphs are especially valuable in settings where information is scattered across different departments or systems, as they help unify and present data in a clear and cohesive way. Well known NLP algorithms are used to create knowledge graphs such as Named <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/named-entity-recognition">Entity Recognition (NER)</a> or <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/topic-modeling">Topic Modelling</a>

            <p><strong>Another key technology </strong> is <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/chatbots#:~:text=A%20chatbot%20is%20a%20computer,and%20automate%20responses%20to%20them.">Chatbots</a> which is a strong application under NLP and increasingly being used to streamline knowledge sharing within organizations. Chatbots, powered by data science and machine learning algorithms, can interact with employees, answer questions (QA Bots), and provide information on demand. This not only reduces the time employees spend searching for information but also ensures that knowledge is consistently available, even in large organizations with complex information systems.

                </p>
                <p> Portfolio GPT is an AI-driven tool developed by UNDP Eurasia to support strategic decision-making by analyzing and synthesizing complex project data. It gathers and integrates information from handbooks, guides, manuals, and real-world experiences from UNDP Country Offices into platforms like Airtable and Trello.</p>
                <p>TThe methodology involves using large language models (LLMs) and prompt engineering to process this data, generating insights and recommendations that align projects with strategic goals. For example, users can input prompts such as "Analyze project outcomes based on portfolio data" or "Generate strategic recommendations for project alignment" to receive tailored advice and insights, helping to improve project efficiency and alignment across various UNDP initiatives.</p>

                    <p>The PASI (Platform for Automated Structured Information) project, developed by Dataverz, focuses on creating a knowledge graph to support sustainability and climate change research. The knowledge graph links data from various sources, including scientific articles, to provide structured information about key entities such as researchers, organizations, and environmental factors. Users can interact with the graph to explore connections and access detailed contextual information.</p>
                    <p>The methodology involves computational techniques like natural language processing (NLP) , specifically data labeling and network analysis methods to extract and organize data efficiently, making it accessible for researchers and policymakers. This approach allows for the discovery of new insights and trends in climate change research, facilitating more informed decision-making.</p>
